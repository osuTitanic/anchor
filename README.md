# Anchor

Anchor is a bancho server designed for support on older osu! clients.
If you find an osu! client for any year or any version, it *will* be able to connect to this server, going as far back as 2007.

Please view [this repository](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic) for setup instructions!

Pretty much everything has been completed now.  
Remaining todo's can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/osuTitanic/projects/2).
